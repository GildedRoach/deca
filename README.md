# (DE)Constructor for (A)pex (DECA)

["Everything should be built top-down, except the first time." - Alan Perlis](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html)

A hacked up tool for exploring/extracting files from Avalanche Studios APEX engine files, 
mainly to explore Generation Zero BETA files until it's released.

Written in Python, tested only on Linux, because this is an experiment in building a library / toolset

## Status
