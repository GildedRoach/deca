# (DE)Constructor for (A)pex (DECA)

["Everything should be built top-down, except the first time." - Alan Perlis](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html)

A hacked up tool for exploring/extracting files from Avalanche Studios APEX engine files, 
mainly to explore Generation Zero BETA files until it's released.

Written in Python, tested only on Linux, code is a mess, because this is an experiment...

## Status
* Extracting all files from GenZ Beta archives
* Parsing files from GenZ Beta archives 
  * 99% ARC/TAB
  * 99% SARC
  * 99% AVTX/DDSC/ATX (image data)
  * 99% AAF
  * 95% ADF
    * Missing GameDataCollection (0x178842fe)
    * Missing MDIC (0xb5b062f1)
    * Missing code for types that do not seem to exist in GZB
    * stringlookup not fully grokked
    * models, hrmesh, mesh, not fully grokked
  * 75% RTPC - parsed but not grokked
  * 10% OBC - found a correlation in file size, guess at record size/count
  * 00% TAG0
  * not touched
    * btc, CFX, RIFF, OGG, lFSB5

Learned basics RPTC and ADF files here and filled in some other holes.

This filled in some holes for the ADF parsing

Got most of the info for parsing the custom image formats came from the source documentation for DirectX
