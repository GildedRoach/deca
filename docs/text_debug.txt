And to be honest, I'm really swamped at work right now. Lamest excuse in the book, I know, but it's true. It's quite bad, we're getting lots of pressure from the guys in suits, and I'm basically living at the lab half of the time. But I should get a couple of days off before Christmas. We'll go have a Christmas dinner at the pizzeria in Fiskebäck.

mission_wm_03_missionitem_02_content	Report on Enemy Tactics
Got ambushed by these... things near the church at 1300 hours. It was a swarm of smaller machines, the size of a large rat. They scuttle on the floor, can creep in to buildings through any vent or opening, and keep jumping at you. Not very sturdy - we managed to take down a couple of them before we had to retreat. Hard to get a line of fire at, though. Recommend using close-range weapons with large spread, possibly birdshot ammo.
worldmission20_info_description	The note says:

"To anyone who finds this note,
We came here from the northern safehouse. That place is not safe anymore! It was overrun by machines and we had to leave our supplies behind and move on. Avoid at any cost!"

Maybe this could be an opportunity to scavenge for new supplies...

Disabling - or even destroying, if need be - the artillery is essential in order to cripple the machines' offensive capabilities.
mission_wm_03_missionitem_01_content	"Dear Mr. Gustafsson,
[...]
I hereby kindly ask you to do what is in your power so that the "Skarven" bunker located on Norra Saltholmen, can be officially decommissioned and turned into a museum.

As you are aware, there haven't been any military operations or stationed personnel at Skarven for over 2 years due to its poor state, and plans to rehabilitate it have been put on hold due to the extremely high costs involved in replacing its obsolete surveillance equipment. 

With the current events in Berlin, one can only hope that this could be a historical time for Europe, and that this will usher in an era of peace where we won't have need for coastal defense. 

When that day finally comes, then --

tut_codex_animalcalls	Animals can make different kinds of calls. When an animal calls, an on-screen indicator will show up to illustrate the general direction of the call. Use {INTERACT} to listen to the call when facing the indicator. This will show information about the species and the type of call.

MATING CALLS
This call type indicates that the animal is looking for a partner, and has a higher likelihood of responding to the use of an animal caller.

WARNING CALLS
This call type indicates that you or another player (in multiplayer) has alerted the animal to your presence by sight, scent, or noise. The animal will be more vigilant, but has not yet fled.

Different species and animals within species have varied calling behaviors. Very difficult animals will rarely make calls.

Call me a coward if you want, but I just couldn't face you, not right now at least, sorry. Fredrik kindly offered to pick up my boxes and stuff at your house on his way to work.

worldmission15_info_description	A few days before the events, a comms operator intercepted an encrypted signal; an unknown speaker was eager to get ahold of a special convoy they lost and that was carrying classified cargo. The only thing the Army could confirm was that the last known position of the cargo was near the crossing of Östervikleden and Åsovägen, in the Sävered area.

mission_wm_16b_missionitem_01_content	This is an article written by columnist Monika Byström in the immediate aftermath of the targeted assassinations of the FOA 53 scientists.

"1 day after the horror, understanding and finding answers
[...] The Östervik region is still in a state of shock and horror after Monday's unprecedented series of assassinations, where 14 people passed away. As it is now known, the common point between 11 of the victims is that they were employees of the same division at the Swedish Defense Research Institute called FOA 53. "Why" - this is the biggest question all their closed ones and any concerned citizen is asking. I believe us journalists have a duty, and my long-time readers will know how dedicated I am to finding out the truth, even if that means stepping on some toes.
[...] One of the victims, Dr. Håkan Pettersson, 58, a respected surgeon who once worked in the Östervik medical center before accepting a job at FOA, was found dead by the police at his home by the Hisingafyren lighthouse. The owner of the nearby "Fyrenkonditori" bakery, his wife Barbro Pettersson has been missing ever since.

"[...]
not yet the time to take drastic measures, such as completely destroying our own battery arsenal. As you no doubt understand, it is our duty to resist any panic reaction, and it is my utmost belief that crippling our capabilities will weaken our long-term defense capabilities.

Therefore, the Minken Command Center is expressly forbidden to take any destructive measures, and is to send massive airborne, seaborne reinforcements and troops to Fort Torsberga in order to rout the enemy threat and fully reclaim the facility. You have your orders.

I fully trust that we will overcome this crisis and learn a great deal about our areas for improvement, and I know that you will all do us proud to defend our country.

Based on a military radio message, the army traced the source of the interference to another of their nearby relays on Norra Saltholmen, and dispatched a team on site but the contact was lost.
There are more relay towers out there, so it is likely that the enemy hacked them to prevent any communication with the outside world.

Mother, Father,
I doubt I will ever not come back, but I hope someone will find this and make sure you get it. I don't know how much time we'll have until the next attack.
You guys always said it was a matter of time before the Russians would invade Sweden. I'm sorry I never believed you.
I get it now, I get how you must have felt back then when the tanks entered Prague. Feeling hopeless, terrified that you might die any time. Startling at every sound you hear in the distance... I'm so thankful you gave me a new home.

collectable_blueprint_13_tank_classa_desc	A very large bipedal enemy that is heavily armored and armed. While they mostly roam alone and can not venture into forests or other non-open spaces, they are formidable foes and should only be attacked with great preparation or high damage weaponry. The prototype version can be armed with combinations of high caliber machine guns, missile barrage pods or a heavy duty sniper rifle. By the blueprints it looks like the most vulnerable components are heavily shielded from the front, but might be easier to hit from the rear. In event of close encounters, the Tank can either perform a deadly stomp, or use a 360 degree concussion pulse to push its enemies away.

On 4 of the scenes, neighbors heard gunshots, but as of now there hasn't been any eye witness on the perpetrator or their vehicle. We should probably write "perpretrators", as everything seem to point at a series of careful planned, cold-blooded executions.
What's even more troubling is that each of the 14 victims lived in the Östervik region, and 11 of them were employees at the Swedish National Defense Research Institute (FOA).
[...]
A visibly shaken Östervik Chief of Police Mats Hansson told us: "This is the first time such a tragedy has happened in this area. It's so quiet here usually. At this stage, we can't confirm any rumors or allegations, but I can tell you that we'll work with the national investigators and do our best to find who did this.[...]"

tut_codex_animalstates	Animals have different behaviors depending on what their current needs are, and whether or not they have been alerted. Over the course of the day, they will seek out need zones for resting, eating, or drinking. They will revisit need zones daily, unless there is hunting pressure in the area. If an animal starts to notice your presence, they will become alerted but not scare immediately. Only when they sense that you are near enough to pose a threat will they start to run away. Fleeing animals will run until they feel safe, and then return to their normal behavior. They will, however, remain vigilant with heightened senses for a short period after having calmed down.

His vitals are stable and he feels fine, but his immune system is predictably weak. We are monitoring him 24-7 and taking steps to prevent his condition from worsening, while ensuring to not trigger a cytokine storm. It's a fine line to walk.

Vehicles can be requested from the Garage, found in the left-hand menu when accessing the store and cache from outposts and tents. 

To request a vehicle, select it in the Garage and press "Request." Your vehicle will be delivered to your location and highlighted with a vehicle icon on your map.

You can also recover vehicles that have been requested and left out in the reserves from the Garage. Recovering a vehicle instantly transports it to your location and repairs any damage that it has sustained out in the field.

Only one vehicle per player can be in the world at any one time. Requesting an additional vehicle removes the first one.

Skills can be active or passive. Only one active skill can be assigned at a time in the skills menu, and then used in-game with {USE_SKILL}.

Skills are tiered. In order to buy higher tiered skills, you must spend a certain amount of points in the previous tier.

Skills come in multiple categories, tailored to different hunting styles. Active pursuit skills are more tied to tracking and stalking, while passive pursuit skills focus on luring.

collectable_blueprint_14_tank_classb_desc	Army designation: Stridsmaskin 90 - "Resen"

A very large bipedal enemy that is heavily armored and armed. While they mostly roam alone and can not venture into forests or other non-open spaces, they are formidable foes and should only be attacked with great preparation or high damage weaponry. The army version has stronger armor and may come fitted with a long range mortar. The army has also allowed the Tank to be fitted with Tick deployment pods and a close range gas release for crowd control. By the blueprints it looks like the most vulnerable components are heavily shielded from the front, but might be easier to hit from the rear. In event of close encounters, the Tank can either perform a deadly stomp, or use a 360 degree concussion pulse to push its enemies away.

[...] There are rumors that the National Defence Research Institute (FOA) and military were affected by power losses and issues with telecommunications. Even if things seem back to normal, the disturbances and blackouts we all experienced in the last few days, as well as the lack of any official statement so far, cause concern.[...]
After all of those big speeches about increasing the military funding, the taxpayers may wonder if their money was put to good use. But more importantly - are Sweden's civilian and military infrastructures strong enough in case of an attack from a foreign power? Are we ready?"

My preliminary observations suggest that the gas is toxic, albeit not lethal and seems to quickly induce a deep comatose state that we haven't been able to reverse at this stage. Their vitals are strong, their brain activity is unaffected, but evidently, any exposure to this substance is extremely dangerous.
