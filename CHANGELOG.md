#### v0.2.0 - "I don't want to do my taxes"
* Decent support for JC4 and RAGE2, no build support for RAGE2 at the moment
* RAGE2 New Files: 
  * ADFs with a single instance and only a hash id of the type
  * "garcs" there are a set of master gt0c files that store info about ee/nl/fl files (which are sarc's in other games)
* New tab based separation of workflow for "extract", "modding", and "3d/GLTF extraction"
